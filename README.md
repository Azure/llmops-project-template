# RAG with Azure AI Studio and Promptflow

This repository has been initialized with the RAG with Azure AI Studio and Promptflow project template repository, which has been thoughtfully crafted with a template for Retrieval Augmented Generation using Promptflow. This template is designed to help you get started quickly and efficiently. The template project is a simplified version of the [Contoso Chat](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-chat/) sample project. 

## Architecture Overview

The following diagram provides an overview of the solution's architecture:

## Project Resources

To deliver the solution effectively, a set of Azure resources is necessary. The following table outlines the required resources and their specific purposes for the project.

| **Resource Name**       | **Purpose**                                                         |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **AI Project**          | Organize and manage Gen AI projects.                                |
| **OpenAI Service**      | Access and use OpenAI models for various AI applications.           |
| **Application Insights**| Monitor application performance and detect issues.                  |
| **Log Analytics**       | Collect, analyze, and visualize logs from your resources.           |
| **Container Registry**  | Store and manage container images for orchestration deployments.    |

| **Storage Account**     | Store and manage data and files used by your application.           |
| **AI Search**           | Implement Vector Search for the RAG retrieval step.                 |
| **App Service**         | Host and manage your app.                                           |
| **App Service Plan**    | Provide the resources that your App Service app needs to run.       |

> **Note:** The **Premium V3 SKU** is required for the Azure App Service Plan to ensure the necessary performance and scalability for the application.



The following deployments will be created in the Azure OpenAI Service:

| Deployment Name          | Model Name             | Model Version | SKU Name | Capacity |
|--------------------------|------------------------|---------------|----------|----------|
| gpt-35-turbo             | gpt-35-turbo           | 0613          | Standard | 20       |
| gpt-4                    | gpt-4o                 | 2024-05-13    | Standard | 20       |
| text-embedding-ada-002   | text-embedding-ada-002 | 2             | Standard | 20       |

To find out if you have a quota for the model in a specific region, refer to the [check your quota](docs/check_your_quota.md) documentation. For more details about the deployments, you can refer to the [ai.yaml](infra/ai.yaml) file. It is important to check if there is a quota for these models in the desired region.

## Infrastructure as Code

To facilitate the creation of resources, this repository includes Bicep templates (IaaC) to create the following project resources. More details can be found in the [main.bicep](infra/main.bicep) file.
